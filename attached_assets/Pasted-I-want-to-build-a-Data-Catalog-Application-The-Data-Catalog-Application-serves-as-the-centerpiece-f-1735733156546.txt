I want to build a Data Catalog Application.
The Data Catalog Application serves as the centerpiece for showcasing metadata, lineage, and data quality metrics of the data products in your Data Mesh framework. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its features, functionalities, and development plan:

Features
1. Metadata Management
* Key Features:
    * Display metadata for each data product:
        * Schema details (column names, data types, constraints).
        * Ownership (domain owner, contact details).
        * SLAs and update frequency.
        * Tags and descriptions.
    * Search and filter capabilities to find data products based on metadata attributes.
* Integration:
    * Retrieve metadata from Databricks Unity Catalog and AWS Glue Catalog using their respective APIs.
2. Lineage Visualization
* Key Features:
    * Interactive lineage graphs showing:
        * Data sources (e.g., S3 buckets, upstream systems).
        * Transformation processes (e.g., ETL workflows in Databricks).
        * Downstream dependencies (e.g., dashboards, applications).
    * Highlight the impact of changes in upstream data on downstream systems.
* Integration:
    * Use Unity Catalog’s lineage API for Delta Tables.
    * Supplement with metadata from Delta Live Tables and Glue Workflows.
3. Data Quality Metrics
* Key Features:
    * Display real-time and historical data quality metrics for each data product, such as:
        * Completeness.
        * Accuracy.
        * Timeliness.
        * Domain-specific checks (e.g., business rule validations).
    * Provide visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to show trends over time.
* Integration:
    * Query APIs exposed by data products to fetch metrics.
    * Store historical metrics in a central location like Amazon DynamoDB or Delta Tables.
4. Data Product Discovery
* Key Features:
    * Enable users to discover data products based on tags, domains, or keywords.
    * Provide recommendations for related or frequently used data products.
* Integration:
    * Use metadata tags from Glue Catalog and Unity Catalog to enable search and discovery.
5. User Access and Permissions
* Key Features:
    * Role-based access control to ensure sensitive data products are only visible to authorized users.
    * Integration with your organization’s IAM system for authentication.
* Integration:
    * Use AWS Lake Formation and Unity Catalog to enforce permissions.

Functionalities
1. API Integration
* Fetch metadata, lineage, and data quality metrics using APIs provided by:
    * Databricks Unity Catalog.
    * AWS Glue Catalog.
    * Custom APIs exposed by data products.
2. Visualizations
* Interactive graphs for lineage and quality metrics.
* Drill-down capabilities to explore specific parts of the lineage or detailed metrics.
3. Alerts and Notifications
* Allow users to set thresholds for data quality metrics.
* Notify users via email or messaging platforms (e.g., Slack) when metrics fall below acceptable levels.
4. Reporting
* Generate reports summarizing metadata, lineage, and data quality metrics for stakeholders.

How to Build the Application
1. Frontend Development
* Framework: Use NextJs an interactive user interface.
* Visualization Tools:
    * Use D3.js for lineage graphs and metric visualizations.
    * Incorporate tables and filters using Material-UI library.
2. Backend Development
* Framework: Use Express.js (Node.js) to build a REST API backend.
* Integration:
    * Call APIs from Unity Catalog, Glue Catalog, and data product APIs.
    * Process and cache data for fast retrieval using Redis.
3. Metadata and Metric Storage
* Store metadata and metrics in:
    * Amazon DynamoDB for real-time lookups.
    * Delta Tables in Databricks for historical and large-scale data.
4. Deployment
* Deploy the application on AWS ECS for scalability.
* Use AWS CloudFront to serve the frontend application globally.
5. Security
* Use AWS Cognito or your organization’s SSO system for user authentication.
* Encrypt all communication using HTTPS.

Integration with Other Applications
1. Databricks Integration:
    * Use Unity Catalog API for metadata and lineage.
    * Query Delta Tables directly for data or metrics.
2. AWS Integration:
    * Use Glue Catalog for metadata and workflows.
    * Query S3 for raw data and logs.
3. BI Tools:
    * Connect the catalog with Power BI, Tableau, or AWS QuickSight for visualization extensions.
4. Notification Systems:
    * Integrate with email systems, Slack, or Microsoft Teams for alerts.

Deliverables
1. A fully functional Data Catalog Application with a responsive UI.
2. APIs integrated with Unity Catalog, Glue Catalog, and data product APIs.
3. Interactive lineage and quality metric visualizations.
4. User access control integrated with IAM.
5. Documentation for users and developers.
This comprehensive application will serve as a cornerstone for demonstrating the value of Data Products and the Data Mesh framework in your organization.
