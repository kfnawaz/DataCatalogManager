A lineage graph for a data product in a data catalog for a Data Mesh architecture should visually represent the flow of data from its origins (source-aligned data products) through intermediate transformations (aggregate data products) to the final consumer-aligned product. This graph provides insights into how the data is sourced, processed, and combined, emphasizing transparency, traceability, and accountability for decentralized ownership.

Features of the Lineage Graph
1. Nodes:
    * Represent data products or entities in the pipeline.
    * Types of nodes:
        * Source-aligned Data Products: Represent raw data from operational or source systems.
        * Aggregate Data Products: Show data transformations, aggregations, or joins.
        * Consumer-aligned Data Product: The final product consumed by end-users or systems.
2. Edges:
    * Represent dependencies and data flow between nodes.
    * Types of relationships:
        * Transformation: Indicates data transformation from one product to another.
        * Consumption: Indicates which products are used as inputs for others.
3. Metadata Display:
    * Each node and edge should display key metadata when selected or hovered:
        * Node: Owner, SLA, quality metrics, version, description.
        * Edge: Type of transformation, frequency of updates, and dependencies.
4. Interactivity:
    * Zoom, pan, and filter capabilities for exploring large graphs.
    * Expand/collapse details for each node or lineage branch.
5. Real-time Updates:
    * Live or regularly updated lineage to reflect changes in data flows or dependencies.

Structure of the Lineage Graph
* Top Level: The Consumer-aligned Data Product as the root node.
* Middle Level: Aggregate Data Products that serve as intermediate steps.
* Bottom Level: Source-aligned Data Products where raw data originates.

Example: Visual Structure for a VaR Report
1. Nodes:
    * Source-aligned Data Products:
        * Trade and Position Data.
        * Market Data.
        * Reference Data.
    * Aggregate Data Products:
        * Portfolio Risk Metrics.
        * Stress Testing and Scenario Data.
        * Market Risk Factors.
    * Consumer-aligned Data Product:
        * VaR Report.
2. Edges:
    * Trade and Position Data → Portfolio Risk Metrics: Transforming trade data to calculate portfolio-level exposures.
    * Market Data + Portfolio Risk Metrics → Market Risk Factors: Deriving risk sensitivities using market data and exposure metrics.
    * Market Risk Factors + Stress Testing → VaR Report: Combining scenario analysis and market sensitivities for VaR computation.

Visualization Example
A possible structure could look like this:
[Trade and Position Data]   [Market Data]   [Reference Data]
                  \                                              |                        /
                   \                                             |                       /
       [Portfolio Risk Metrics]   [Market Risk Factors]
                              \                                         /
               [Stress Testing and Scenario Data]
                                                   |
                                      [VaR Report]

Key Features in a Data Catalog
1. Drill-Down Capabilities:
    * Clicking on a node (e.g., "Portfolio Risk Metrics") reveals:
        * Data schema.
        * Owners and maintainers.
        * Transformation logic.
        * Data quality metrics.
2. Dependency Mapping:
    * Identify upstream and downstream dependencies to evaluate the impact of changes or issues in data products.
3. Integrated APIs:
    * APIs to fetch metadata, quality metrics, or lineage information dynamically.
4. Version History:
    * Track changes to data products over time, ensuring auditability.
5. Annotations and Tags:
    * Add descriptions or business rules for each data product or edge.
