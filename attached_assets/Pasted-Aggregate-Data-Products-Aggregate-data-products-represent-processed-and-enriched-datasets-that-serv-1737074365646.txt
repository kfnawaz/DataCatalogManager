Aggregate Data Products:
Aggregate data products represent processed and enriched datasets that serve as intermediate layers for the VaR calculation.
a. Portfolio Risk Metrics
* Purpose: Aggregate risk metrics at the portfolio level.
* Inputs:
    * Position-level risk metrics.
    * Market data (e.g., volatility, correlation).
* Outputs:
    * Portfolio-level sensitivities (delta, gamma, vega).
    * Aggregated risk exposure by asset class or geography.
b. Stress Testing and Scenario Data
* Purpose: Provide precomputed stress test results for different market scenarios.
* Inputs:
    * Historical market data.
    * Scenario definitions (e.g., economic shocks, black swan events).
* Outputs:
    * Stress test results for portfolio and position levels.
    * Impact analysis of extreme market movements.
c. Market Risk Factors
* Purpose: Provide aggregated data on market risk factors such as volatility, correlations, and interest rate curves.
* Inputs:
    * Source-aligned market data.
* Outputs:
    * Cleaned and aggregated time series data for risk factors.
    * Forward-looking metrics like implied volatility surfaces.
d. Counterparty Risk Metrics
* Purpose: Aggregate counterparty risk exposure metrics.
* Inputs:
    * Source-aligned counterparty exposure data.
    * Credit ratings, default probabilities.
* Outputs:
    * Aggregated counterparty exposure and credit risk metrics.
e. Regulatory Metrics
* Purpose: Provide precomputed regulatory metrics related to VaR (e.g., Basel III compliance).
* Inputs:
    * Source-aligned regulatory data.
* Outputs:
    * Precomputed regulatory measures such as capital charge for market risk.



Consumer-Aligned Data Product:
VaR Report Data Product
* Purpose: Provide a comprehensive Value at Risk report, summarizing the potential loss in portfolio value due to market movements.
* Inputs:
    * Aggregated risk metrics (from aggregate data products).
    * Market data.
    * Portfolio and position-level data.
    * Historical and simulated data for stress testing.
* Consumers: Risk managers, regulatory reporting teams, portfolio managers.
* Attributes:
    * Daily, weekly, or intraday VaR calculations.
    * Stress testing and scenario analysis.
    * Historical VaR trends.
