Lineage-related functionalities in a Data Catalog application designed for Data Products in a financial firm should focus on providing detailed insights into how data flows through the organization's systems, enabling traceability, accountability, and compliance. Below are key lineage-related functionalities:

1. End-to-End Lineage Visualization
Data Flow Mapping: Visualize the complete journey of data from source systems (e.g., trade systems, market feeds) to the consumer-aligned data products (e.g., VaR Reports).
Graphical Representation: Interactive lineage graphs showing nodes (data products, sources, transformations) and edges (data flow dependencies).
Hierarchical Views: Drill-down views of lineage at different granularities (e.g., source-to-aggregate-to-consumer-aligned products).
2. Transformation Tracking
Transformation Steps: Document and display transformations applied to data, including calculations, aggregations, and filtering (e.g., how "stress_scenario_impact" in VaR Reports is calculated).
Code/Logic Metadata: Include metadata or links to transformation logic (SQL queries, Python scripts, or ETL processes).
Version History: Maintain historical versions of transformations to enable rollback or audits.
3. Dependency Analysis
Upstream Dependencies: Identify all upstream data sources or products that a data product depends on (e.g., VaR Report depends on Portfolio Risk Metrics and Market Data).
Downstream Impact Analysis: Show downstream dependencies to highlight the potential impact of changes to a specific data product or source.
4. Data Provenance
Source Tracking: Document the origin of every data attribute, including the systems or data sources they were ingested from.
Data Quality Indicators: Display data quality metrics associated with the source (e.g., accuracy, completeness, timeliness).
5. Change Management
Impact of Schema Changes: Automatically identify and flag downstream data products impacted by schema changes in upstream sources.
Version Comparisons: Highlight differences between versions of data products or their schemas over time.
6. Compliance and Audit Trails
Regulatory Traceability: Ensure compliance with financial regulations like Basel III, MiFID II, and others by documenting data flow for audit purposes.
Access Logs: Record who accessed or modified lineage data and when, for audit and governance purposes.
7. Data Quality and Validation Lineage
Validation Checks: Track which validation rules or data quality checks were applied to the data at each stage (e.g., threshold checks, duplicate removal).
Metrics Propagation: Display how data quality metrics (e.g., accuracy, completeness) propagate through lineage paths.
8. Metadata Integration
Attribute-Level Lineage: Provide lineage at the attribute level, showing how specific fields in downstream products map back to upstream sources.
Contextual Metadata: Include contextual metadata, such as business definitions, owners, and tags, alongside lineage information.
9. Collaboration and Notifications
Lineage Collaboration: Allow users to comment, annotate, or tag specific lineage paths or nodes for collaboration.
Impact Notifications: Notify stakeholders of lineage changes that might affect their data products or workflows.
10. Integration with Analytical Tools
Data Querying: Allow users to query lineage paths directly from analytical environments like Databricks or AWS.
External Tool Integration: Support integrations with BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) or data orchestration platforms to enhance lineage traceability.
